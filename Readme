This repository contains the implementation details/code for anomaly detection in building's energy consumption. The reader is suggested to read through the paper to know about the approaches in detail.

For short-term data, 
Dataset: Energy-Dataset --> Pecan_weekday_house_mat and Pecan_weekend_house_mat (Pecan street data from 10 houses)
Code: Gen_labels.m is used to generate anomaly scores and labels depending on the user defined threshold.

For long-term data,
Dataset: HouseData_15_18 (Private 3years data from 5 houses)
Code: weatherNormalisedData.m is used to annotate the year long observations.

To evaluate the performance metrics, 
Dataset: Peccan street data
Code: MetricEval.m is used to compare all the performance metrics discussed in the paper.
