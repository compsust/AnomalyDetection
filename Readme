This repository contains the implementation details/code for anomaly detection in building's energy consumption. The reader is suggested to read through the paper to know about the approaches in detail.

For short-term data, 
Dataset: Dataport Dataset (2 months data from 10 houses)
This meter-level data is grouped into weekdays and weekends. Pecan_weekday_house_mat and Pecan_weekend_house_mat are the matlab files containing weekday and weekend data across all houses.
Code: Gen_labels.m is used to generate anomaly scores and labels depending on the user defined threshold.

For long-term data,
Dataset: HUE Dataset (3years data from 5 houses)
Code: weatherNormalisedData.m is used to annotate the year long observations.

To evaluate the performance metrics, 
Dataset: Peccan street data
Code: MetricEval.m is used to compare all the performance metrics discussed in the paper.

Another contribution of this paper is in publishing the annotated anomalies obtained from short-range and long-range datasets. The csv files are named as Hue_House_anomalies and Dataport_House_anomalies.

Please cite our paper if you use our data or annotated anomalies as a benchmark for your research.
